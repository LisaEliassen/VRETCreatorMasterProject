Thank you for buying my asset. In the asset there are two variants of animations: the root motion and in place.
 Animator is missing. 
In case you want to cut such animations like sleeping, eating and drinking, here is the length of these animations:
- drink, eat,  sleep, agression - 15 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- sit - 25 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- lie - 35 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- hide - 20 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
